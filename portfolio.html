		<h5><i>Abstract:</i><h5>
		
		<p>Ophthalmologists frequently employ fundus scans because they are quite effective at identifying a variety of retinal problems. This was utilized 
		to determine the many eye illnesses, such as cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, etc. The severity of the disorders can also be predicted using
		these fundus images, which can also offer early symptoms or warnings. In recent years, many machine learning algorithms have become increasingly important
		in the field of medicine, and ophthalmology is no exception. In this study, we use deep neural networks to automatically categorize retinal fundus images 
		into healthy and pathological states. As a result of the superior machine learning technique known as deep learning, which has shown to be particularly
		accurate in solving computer vision problems. In our study, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were utilized to categorize the retinal pictures as healthy or unhealthy.</p>
